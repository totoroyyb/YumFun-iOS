## How to run?
There are two ways of running our app.

*Please use the `main` branch, which will remain unchanged after ddl. Other branchs might still involves changes.*

1. Build from source. Theoretically, all necessary files has been included inside this repo. You shouldn't need any additional step. If pod files are missing, please run `pod install` first. You might need to remove the Team ID from the project settings page. If `push notification` entitlement has some trouble to build this app, you can just remove it.
2. Download from [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/yrtyPOHQ). **Note:** This version on the TestFlight might not identical to the one in the main branch. As we might keeps improving this app and publish to the TestFlight after DDL. So `main` branch shall be the source of truth of submitted Final Project.
