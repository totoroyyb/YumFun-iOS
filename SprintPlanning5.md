## Brief Summary of Our Project

YumFun is a social app that makes it easy to create, share, and use recipes with friends. 
We have finalized our login, backend, profile, recipe input and parsing features, and are currently working on polishing and debugging the cook mode and recipe input UI and flow, 
as well as removing features beyond our scope.
