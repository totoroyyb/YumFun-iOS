# Sprint Planning 4



## Next Steps

- Merging all core UI-related work, like all basic views, onto main branch
- Hooking up everything
- Polish on UI
- Finishing touch on Cooking Mode and Collab Cooking.



## Brief Summary of Our Project

YumFun is a social app that makes it easy to create, share, and use recipes with friends. 
We are currently polishing the login, finalizing our backend for profiles and sharing recipes in firebase, and finishing up our recipe input, recipe display, home screen, and profile views.

We also designed cook mode and collaborative cook mode for cooking with friends, and utilized machine learning for recognizing hand gestures.
