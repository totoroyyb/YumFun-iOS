# Sprint Planning 2



## Next Steps

- Finish wireframing so all UI is clear and we create view controllers 
- Fill out M1 document with third party libraries, view controllers, implementation estimations
- Keep trello board updated
- Plan for progress check-in Sunday at 6:30 pm



## Brief Summary of Our Project

YumFun is a social app that makes it easy to create, share, and use recipes. We are currently wireframing each of these aspects and are setting up the backend in firebase. Once we have finished wireframing, we will start implementing our respective parts.



## Other Resource

### Link to our up-to-date trello board

- https://trello.com/b/n7b35fDs/cookingapp

### Notes that includes what people have done, what they plan to do, etc for each individual in the group

- Links to all commits that correspond to the tasks that people have done

- If you did a task that didn't require any code (e.g., test out API foo to see if it works), put a description of the task instead of a link to a commit
