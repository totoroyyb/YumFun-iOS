# Sprint Planning 3



## Next Steps

- Finish recipe input and profile view
- Hook up home view with login and setup navigation buttons
- Start working on cooking mode: timer, image and voice recognization
- Setup backend for cooking mode and saving images/videos



## Brief Summary of Our Project

YumFun is a social app that makes it easy to create, share, and use recipes with friends. 
We are currently polishing the login, finalizing our backend for profiles and sharing recipes in firebase, and finishing up our recipe input, recipe display, home screen, and profile views.
We are also starting to design cook mode and the backend for cooking with friends, and have started looking into machine learning for recognizing hand gestures.
